# AI vs Human Art Classifier

This is a simple data science project that classifies images as either AI-generated or human-created using scikit-learn models like logistic regression and SVM. The goal is to demonstrate basic image processing and classification using Python.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains image datasets
- `src/preprocessing.py`: Loads and prepares image data
- `src/model.py`: Trains and evaluates the classifier
- `src/predict.py`: Runs predictions on new images

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for required libraries.
